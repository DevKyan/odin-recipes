    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>PB&J frozen yogurt bark is such a fun, refreshing, healthy, and kid-friendly school snack — and, if you’re at home, you can just grab a piece from the freezer.</p>
    <p>You can also add some fun ingredients, like nuts, coconut flakes, or even mini chocolate chips to make it special.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (1 pint) fresh strawberries, hulled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon lime juice</li>
        <li>2  cups unsweetinged low-fat greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup smooth peanut butter ( or almond butter or another nut butter)</li>
        <li>1 cup frtesh or frozen berries of your choice</li>
        <li>optional toppings: nuts, coconut flakes, mini chocolate chips</li>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, place the strawberry chunks, honey, and lime juice and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a heavy saucepan and simmer until the foam disappears and the puree reduces by half, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Note: This will make more strawberry puree than you need for the bark (you only need about 1/4 cup of puree). Save the rest for another batch or use it as a fruit spread on pancakes or to flavor plain yogurt.</li>
        <li>On a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper, spoon the yogurt and spread it into a thin layer, approximately 1 centimeter deep.</li>
        <li>On the stove or in the microwave, gently warm the peanut butter just until it is pourable. You may need to add some water to thin it down.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the peanut butter and then the strawberry puree onto the yogurt. Then, use a knife to make swirling patterns (or other designs, like hearts or circles).</li>
        <li>Place the additional berries and any optional toppings on the bark.</li>
        <li>Freeze for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove and break into squares.</li>
    </ol>
