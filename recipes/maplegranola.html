    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a family favorite for weekday breakfasts. It's incredibly simple to make and allows for customization to suit your preferences. Feel free to experiment with different nut and seed combinations, spices, or even substitute honey for maple syrup.</p>
    <p>Egg whites are used to create crunchy oat clusters, but the recipe remains delicious and crunchy even if omitted for a vegan option.</p>
    <p>The baked oatmeal bars stay fresh for at least 3 weeks when stored in a tightly sealed glass container like a Mason jar. Enjoy!</p>
